- **Typography**: Classes for font family, size, weight, and alignment.
- **Colors**: Classes for text and background colors.
- **Layout**: Classes for display, flexbox, and grid properties.

- **Borders**: Classes for border width, style, and color.
- **Shadows**: Classes for box-shadow and text-shadow properties.

## Customization

These utility classes are designed to be customized to fit your personal preferences. You can modify the values of the classes to suit your needs.

## Usage
